# first-project
My First Project on Github

The purpose of this project is to make predictions based on a provided .csv file. 

Simply clone this project and run main.py

You need to provide a path to a .csv file and then you would first need to tell the program which column contains the right answer. 
Then indicate the column you'd like to use to make a prediction.

For example, in the SeoulBikeData.csv file I have provided you would have to put column 1 as the column the program needs to learn the final answer from and column 2,3,4,5,6,7 as the input for the ML algo to learn. 

After that you will a bar chart where it shows you how accurate the linear regression model was.
